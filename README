django-admin-histograms
=======================

To use this app simple have your ``ModelAdmin`` subclass 
``django_histograms.admin.HistogramAdmin`` and give it a ``histogram_field``
attribute with the name of a ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` to create the
histogram over.  Then you can pull up 
``localhost:8000/your_app/your_model/report/`` to see the histogram (adjust the
URL as necessary).

The designs came from Wilson Miner's article on data visualization for A List
Apart.
